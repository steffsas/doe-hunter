# (mandatory) 
# Path to coverprofile file (output of `go test -coverprofile` command).
#
# For cases where there are many coverage profiles, such as when running 
# unit tests and integration tests separately, you can combine all those
# profiles into one. In this case, the profile should have a comma-separated list 
# of profile files, e.g., 'cover_unit.out,cover_integration.out'.
profile: profile.cov

# (optional; but recommended to set) 
# When specified reported file paths will not contain local prefix in the output
local-prefix: "github.com/org/project"

# Holds coverage thresholds percentages, values should be in range [0-100]
threshold:
  # (optional; default 0) 
  # The minimum coverage that each file should have
  file: 70

  # (optional; default 0) 
  # The minimum coverage that each package should have
  package: 80

  # (optional; default 0) 
  # The minimum total coverage project should have
  total: 90

# Holds regexp rules which will exclude matched files or packages 
# from coverage statistics
exclude:
  # Exclude files or packages matching their paths
  paths:
    - sleeper.go    # excludes sleeper
 
# NOTES:
# - symbol `/` in all path regexps will be replaced by current OS file path separator
#   to properly work on Windows
